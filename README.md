# A Note by the TA:
"Those who are facing latency issues when playing the game on multiple computers should make an attempt to minimize the latency but at the very least the game should be startable across multiple laptops. It is not enough for the game to only be playable on a single computer." 

I run on the same computer; Can you work on what the TA is talking about?  Also, I run with 2 players so far; It should work for n players but not tested yet.
